# MyRIO-Robot
Robot which uses a MyRIO and a Raspberry Pi.

This is a work in progress but as it stands the robot can do independent wheel speed control of 4 separate motors using encoders and it can communicate over shared network variables and web services to a browser or an iPad/Android device through Data Dashboard.
